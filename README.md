# PA9122 TODO
## Break these into subtasks if need be
- [X] Display board on screen
- [X] Display pieces on screen (we can do this using the board coordinates defined in Class Board)
- [X] Allow pieces to be moved (should snap to nearest tile)
- [X] Implement the logic to check where a piece can move (have to do this for every piece)
- [ ] Detect check, checkmate
- [ ] Set up actual game (turn based, only allow legal moves)
- [ ] Fix up any glitches or small stuff like castling and en passant (could skip if no time)
- [ ] Implement the main menu and other stuff like that

## Extras
- [ ] Play vs CPU
- [ ] Settings
- [ ] Sound
- [ ] Sockets (multiplayer) for 50pts - could be simple could be absurdly hard
